## About the project

<strong>Look away!</strong> It's not interesting yet. Currently it is just a collection of simple tests and a couple of not-yet implemented interfaces.

This is a project that explores the test-driven development process and gitflow for unity projects in order to create a ship simulation game.

Currently the master branch is empty, because the project is still in early development. Look in development branch

## Current goals

The primary goal right now is building a solid foundation to work with. The first thing is the ship interface `IShip.cs`. This needs to perfect before proceeding.

During this, the ship implementation is being developed. Development is test-driven using mocks/stubs.

## Getting started
This is a walkthrough of how to get the project up and running on your own machine.
### Prerequisites

[Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download "Unity's download page")  (Built on 2022.1.0a12 Alpha)

### Installation
1. Clone project
2. Open using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download "Unity's download page") or [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download "Unity's download page")

## Test-driven development ([TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development "Wikipedia article"))

TDD is the development style that dictates that tests are written before the code for them are.
